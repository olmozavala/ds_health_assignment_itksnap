# Understanding body planes through MRIs and ItkSnap

The objectives of this homework are:
1. Get familiar with the software [ItkSnap](http://www.itksnap.org) and [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/).
2. Understand the three body planes (Transverse, Sagittal, and Coronal)
3. Introduce the student to the [Itk](https://itk.org/) library and the basic IO functionality. 
4. Continue practicing with [Jupyter Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Body planes and ItsSnap/3D Slicer

Using [this T1-weighted MRI brain image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bds7Odk_Ugh-Ygc1L0grxEyKFh7xLe2U/view?usp=share_link)
try to identify the following regions in the brain:
* From a Sagittal view:
  * Cerebellum
  * Medulla Oblongata
  * Corpus Callosum
* From a Coronal view:
  * Optic nerve
  * Sylvian fissure
* From a Transverse (Trans) view:
  * Lateral ventricle
  * Caudate nucleus

Google the regions of the brain to find out more information:

For each case make a screenshot of the identified region using the proper plane view and mark the region with an
image-editing software like Photoshop, [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/), Paint, or even Powerpoint.
